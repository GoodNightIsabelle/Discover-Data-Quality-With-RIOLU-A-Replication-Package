# Anomaly Detection Dataset
## Source 
The data (both real-life raw version and the cleaned version) originally comes from previous data quality studies. We selected several columns in the datasets that contain pattern violation issues for RIOLU's anomaly detection evaluation. 
1. ```Hosp-1k, Hosp-10k, Hosp-100k```: Hospital data from US Department of Health & Human Services. ([original](https://github.com/visenger/clean-and-dirty-data))
3. ```Flights```: Flight depature/arrival data from 3 airline websites (AA, UA, and Continental), 8 airport websites (e.g., SFO, DEN), and 27 third-party websites (e.g., Orbitz, Travelocity). ([original](https://github.com/visenger/clean-and-dirty-data))
4. ```Movies```: IMdB film dataset.  ([original](https://github.com/BigDaMa/raha/tree/master/datasets/movies_1))
